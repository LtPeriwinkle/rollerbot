# rollerbot


my first haskell project, made for a friend on discord.


## usage

put your bot token in a file called `.bot-token` and run `cabal run` to start


`!roll XdY` (where X and Y are integers) to roll arbitrary numbers of arbitrarily-sided dice.
works on any number, not just traditional dice side counts.
